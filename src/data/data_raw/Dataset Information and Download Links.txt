Image DeepFake Detection Challenge Dataset Information and Required Links for download

Due to file size storage constraint on Github, currently, we can only provide links to the required data sources.
Team members can download them (both Training and Test data) from these links.
We are not using Google Drive for now as it also has 15 GB storage constraint.

Meanwhile, we will try to figure out a solution.


Training Dataset (both Real and Fake) can be download from below link under the section "Release of full training set" (TASK 1):
