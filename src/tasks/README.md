# ${Task \space Folder \space Details}$

Note : Please Follow the below guidelines to create task folders
- Task Folder Naming Convention : _task-n-taskname.(n is the task number)_  ex: task-1-data-analysis, task-2-model-deployment etc.
- All Task folder names should be in chronologial order (from 1 to n)
- All Task folders should have a README.md file with task Details and task goals along with an info table containing all code/notebook files with their links and information
- Task folders that contain sub-tasks can create sub folders within the task.
- __Update the below table explaining the task details.__

### Task Table

| ${Task \space No}$ | ${Task \space Name}$ | ${Details}$ | ${Task \space Leader}$ |
|-|-|-|-|
|1| task-1-data-collection | Collection of data from various sources. The data collected will be then sent for the pre-processing | ${Parnika \space Damle}$ |
|2| task-2-data-preprocessing | Preprocessing the dataset so that it is in proper shape for the feature extraction to work on | ${Rishabh \space Sabharwal}$ |
|3| task-3-feature-extraction | Working on the pre-processed dataset to extract the relevant features and supply them for the model training purposes | ${Vishu \space Kalier}$ |
|4| task-4-model-training | Tranining the model on te provided dataset so that the model is well-trained before testing and cross-validation | ${Vishu \space Kalier}$ |
|5| task-5-model-testing-and-validation | Testing and Validating on the test and validation dataset to cross-check the accuracy of the model | ${Akash \space Kundu}$ |
|6| task-6-model-deployment | Deployment of the model which has been trained, tested and cross-validated | ${Harsha \space Tejaswi}$ |
|7|Political Rationale| The entire basis of the political rationale is to create a document upon which we could use as a basis to know if the direction of our current application is viable or not|
