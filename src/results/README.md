# Results

The classification matrix of our proposed MobileNetV3 model was compared with the top 5 teams that participated in the competition.
The results are as follows:

| a) VisionLabs | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
| Real | 0.89 | 0.88 | 0.89 |
| Deepfake | 0.95 | 0.96 | 0.96 |
| Accuracy | | | 0.94 |
| b) DC-GAN (amped team) | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
| Real | 0.86 | 0.78 | 0.82 |
| Deepfake | 0.92 | 0.95 | 0.93 |
| Accuracy | | | 0.90 |
| c) Team Nirma | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
| Real | 0.55| 0.80 | 0.65 |
| Deepfake | 0.90 | 0.74| 0.81 |
| Accuracy | | | 0.75|
| d) AIMH Lab | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
| Real | 0.52 | 0.49 | 0.51 |
| Deepfake | 0.80 | 0.82 | 0.81 |
| Accuracy | | | 0.73 |
| e) PRA Lab-Div. Biometria | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
| Real | 0.43 | 0.76 | 0.55 |
| Deepfake | 0.86 | 0.59 | 0.70 |
| Accuracy | | | 0.64 |
| f) Proposed Model | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
| Real | 0.63 | 0.82 | 0.71 |
| Deepfake | 0.92 | 0.81 | 0.86 |
| Accuracy | | | 0.81 |

Based on the results, it is apparent that our model achieved significantly better performance compared to “Team Nirma” which ranked third in the competition. With the exception of the top two teams, Visionlabs and Amped Team, our proposed model outperforms all the other teams present in the competition.
