# ${Omdena \space Munich \space Deepfake \space Image \space Detection}$


## ${Problem \space Statement}$
Deepfake generators have been able to produce imitations almost undetectable through human inspection. Per se, Deepfake detection is one of the notable challenges of digital forensics and media security. They can be used for:

* Spreading false information and manipulating public opinion.
* Defaming, harassing, or blackmailing individuals.
* Damaging the credibility of media information and undermining trust.
* Spreading fake news, making political propaganda, and manipulating elections. An artificial intelligence (AI) solution can help identify Deepfake images with accuracy and precision.


## ${Project \space Goal}$
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model for classifying facial images with a high accuracy (95%).

## ${Project \space API}$
The model has been deployed to the following endpoint: https://vinodcherian-deepfake-detection-project-ycmbu6.streamlit.app/Predict_Image
